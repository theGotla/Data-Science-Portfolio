I can help with gardening, which once was a big interest of mine, or maybe someone needs a house sitter or dog walker. Dogs seem to like me but I have very little experience. I'm pretty proud of my ethics and my ethos. Maybe someone is attracted to that. I have always been very reliable but might have some issues with it now. I have other problems too.

"Kind, Simpatica Transwoman Seeks Live/Work Exchange",https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/res/d/kind-simpatica-transwoman-seeks-live/7415670904.html,"I'm an older, semi-retired person looking to exchange my hard work as a housekeeper, cook, personal or legal assistant/secretary, driver and/or music teacher for the use of an apartment, in-law unit or room in the greater Bay Area. Since I currently work part-time and have retirement income, I am able to do an even exchange and do not require cash compensation.
I'm a shy, quiet person and would prefer to have my own separate place, but I'll consider a live-in position if it's comfortable given my gender situation. I am not qualified by training or life experience to care for someone dealing with serious physical/medical challenges. But for someone who has work that needs to be done, who could benefit from having a caring, responsible person in-home, and who can appreciate the warmth and nurturing qualities that this old-fashioned feminine lady brings to the task, it just might be a good fit.
I have had a long and fulfilling career in music, having worked professionally as a performing and recording musician, arranger/producer for a record label, and as a music teacher for more than twenty years here in the Bay Area. In the legal field, I've researched and written successful motions in the California Court of Appeal, one step below the state Supreme Court. But the job that I'm seeking now is not the one that is the most lucrative, or the most prestigious. The most fulfilling and meaningful job for me is the one that I can do safely and comfortably as a woman.
While many contemporary women have opted to liberate themselves from traditional feminine roles, and seek ""empowerment"" in the male-dominated realms of business and politics, I embrace the traditional feminine roles of homemaker, secretary and personal assistant which are greatly undervalued in a patriarchal, materialist society, and which are harmonious with my nature in ways that worldly success can never equal. It has always been clear to me that a woman's true power does not derive from wealth, fame or social status, but comes from within herself, and flows naturally and spontaneously from who she is. ""Liberation"" for this lady is simply about living and working as my true, feminine self.
I am open to people of all genders and ethnicities. Responses from members, friends and allies of the trans community are especially welcome. I am fully vaccinated against COVID, and available to start working now or as needed."

Live-in Caregiver,https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/res/d/live-in-caregiver/7408007168.html,"Exceptional certified caregiver available for full time 6-7 days live-in.
Are you tired of paying a, ""King's Ransom"", for substandard in-home healthcare services? Are you frustrated with the revolving door practices of in-home healthcare agencies, with their streaming flow of caregivers in and out of you or your loved one's home? What about the endless pages of contracts, time-and-a-half for holidays, and perpetual fees and rate increases? If you are ready to end this dysfunctional relationship with in-home healthcare agencies, then please call me.
My extensive experience working as a certified caregiver, in the in-home healthcare industry, comprises more than 19 years of administering comprehensive non-medical care to individuals who experienced various chronic illnesses, including but not limited to; Alzheimer's/Dementia, cancer, depression, Diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, heart disease, pulmonary diseases, Multiple Sclerosis, Myasthenia Gravis, and Parkinson's Disease. My experience also includes hospice care.
As a certified caregiver, I have always been, ""Client Focused"". My commitment to providing exemplary care involves ongoing caregiver continuing education, maintaining current CPR/AED and First-Aid certifications, immunizations, TB Skin Test and Covid 19 vaccine.
I pay for my own health insurance, file and pay annual income taxes.
I am in good health, do not drink, smoke , or use illicit drugs and can perform any physical tasks relative to the needs of my client.
Creativity, an empathetic nature, patience, excellent communication and interpersonal skills underlie my ability to connect with my client, and employ innovative ways to enhance their life. I possess superb organizational and domestic skills. My interests and talents are varied. I enjoy cooking, the arts, reading, writing poetry, designing jewelry, ceramics, hiking, kayaking and many other activities
Affordability is an important factor of an individual's decision to remain in their home. This is why my rates are considerably less than agencies. At a rate of $250.00/day or $20.00/hour, you or your loved one will receive comprehensive non-medical care, which surpasses the services provided by in-home healthcare agencies. There are no contracts, no annual rate increases, and no time-and-a-half for holidays.
Working in the in-home healthcare industry has truly enriched my life. Providing care companionship , comfort, and sharing in the lives of those who are in their crowning years, are both a privilege and a blessing.
My employment and personal references are impeccable and will be promptly provided upon request.
I can also provide an updated resume.
The information, above, briefly describes my background. A preliminary telephone interview and a personal meeting would allow the opportunity for a greater exchange of information.
I look forward to hearing from you.

"Super SEO Expert – Proven, Many Clients, Affordable",https://sfbay.craigslist.org/nby/res/d/super-seo-expert-proven-many-clients/7414945879.html,"Search engine ranking (or search engine optimization) is a very critical aspect of your website if you’re selling products or marketing your services. You know the question: how will you sell your products or services if nobody is finding your store? – your store or office being your online website.
My approach to SEO is based on 12 years of experience with Google, the major factor in search engine ranking, and by extension including the minor search engines.
Today, this is called digital marketing, or online marketing, and includes SEO, social media marketing, pay per click ads, and ad retargeting – all of which I’m expert in, and have many years experience in.
I live here in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I love talking to new people about their online marketing needs. I can quickly show you how your site is not performing, and how it can be brought up to the best performance possible.
I have many clients in the Bay Area, who market locally and nationally, or just locally. For their keyword phrases that they’re targeting for ranking, I’ve brought them to page 1 of Google results, and to the top or near the top of Google, quickly or over time – depending on the level of competition. In some, low competition cases, extremely high page 1 ranking is achieved in a matter of days.
Really effective SEO combines a deep, experienced understanding of how the search engines make their algorithmic determinations on indexing and ranking of sites. This comes from years of experience, and observing how the engines respond to SEO approaches. Next is excellent copywriting or content writing for the entire SEO best practices approach. SEO copywriting is very specialized, and includes the title and description meta tags, the alt image meta tags, H1 headers in the on-page copy, and the copy itself.
I also offer the full compliment of social media marketing, pay per click advertising and other channels.
And I also do full on web design/development.
Contact me for a free review of your site (on whatever platform), and my recommendations for successful site ranking either locally or nationally, or both.
Thank you…"

"Top Local Website Design, SEO, SMM, Content Writing",https://sfbay.craigslist.org/nby/res/d/top-local-website-design-seo-smm/7405558800.html,"Hello. As local web designer and online marketing freelancers in Greenbrae, Marin County, in the north Bay, we bring our 15 years of skills in webdesign and SEO and other digital marketing avenues powerfully and smartly to each of our clients. Whether your business is localized to the SF Bay Area or national in scope.
We provide affordable, beautifully conceived, well strategized website design and development - designed towards the Holy Grail of visitor-to-client conversion - the process of psychologically inspiring and funneling visitors to become customers or clients. We work in Wordpress for many sites (giving a great range of functionality), and custom HTML for others, and for ecommerce sites (of which we also have our own) we use the Shopify online shopping platform or Wordpress.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - alongside of site design, or as an independent project. We are also expertly well versed, very experienced and successful in SEO strategy and implementation. Many web site designers state this, but we have been doing expert level, white hat SEO for 12 years, and have a very successful track record. We offer stand alone SEO services, and are the SEO master guides for several Bay Area marketing brokers.
In addition to SEO, we've developed expert level skill sets in SMM, social media marketing, and keep up to date on the latest methods for creating traffic funnels to sites, and building consumer and customer awareness and loyalty. We now work with apps that greatly increase the exponential power of social media marketing.
And, finally, we offer critical skills in content writing - this including on page copy that contributes to visitor knowledge, marketing value propositions, call to actions and the all important visitor-to-client conversion. And, of course, SEO is largely an art of content writing using the keyword phrases (that we deeply research) that are essential to your products or services.
We are local and don't farm out our work to others, anywhere.
Graphic Design
We also provide for clients creative, persuasive, contemporary (or period style) graphic design, and have worked on projects ranging from comprehensive book design and publishing to presentation brochures and folders, sample binders, ads in national magazines (Architectural Digest), posters, post cards, logos, and much more.
Please contact us for two portfolio links.
Website Design (Web Designer)
We've been executing creative web design and development for many years - bringing the knowledge, aesthetics, psychological analysis of audience and professional-level expectations of the print world to the web world. For each design or writing project I work with the client closely to explore their needs, and to offer my insight and advice as to a final outcome that performs beyond expectations. I offer a full range of design approaches and philosophies, keeping familiar with current trends and techniques, but also tacking close to traditional values of great design and development. We expertly utilize Wordpress for design/developing websites, as well as custom HTML sites if that is what you wish, and ecommerce sites we use Shopify or Wordpress. We also maintain websites in many different platforms, making updates for clients."

OBJECTIVE
I am a former Administrative Assistant that retired young due to a mental disability. I am looking for a part-time job to get me out of the house two days per week hopefully with a salary of not more than $800.00 a month as I am on Social Security Disability. I am allowed to work up to this amount each month and there is also a tax credit for any future employers for hiring me.
I would like to change careers from Commercial Property Management to Restaurants. I spent several years at Cabrillo College's Sesnon House, a four star restaurant, waitressing and teaching students how to apply their lab knowledge to an actual restaurant. My goal is to learn enough to open my own cafe and step in if the chef ever quits. I would like to be cross trained on every position from Dish Pit to Restaurant Manager.

Truck driver class A,https://seattle.craigslist.org/tac/res/d/truck-driver-class/7416023222.html,"Hello, I'm looking for a local trucking position, the occasional overnight doesn't bother me. I was buying my own truck but some personal things happened with my ex and I, I am no longer able to maintain that lifestyle. I would love to just keep it to 10 hours a day m-f and I need to gross 1500 a week minimum. No weekends as I have my kids every other weekend. The weekends I don't have them then it would be okay to work. I'm experienced in flat bed, dry van and reefer. Looking for weekly pay but you MUST be accommodating in the fact I can't really work weekends. Would definitely prefer daytime work. I don't care if it starts at 3am, that's okay. I enjoy driving those early mornings. Looking to start ASAP. can drive Auto or 10-13 spd manual. Not dumb so I could definitely learn 15 or 18 with no issues. I would also (not mandatory) love somewhere I could bring the truck home. Also, I am a smoker so if you don't want your trucks smoked in, I'm not your guy.
As for myself:
I've been driving for 14 years legally on and off. I started driving down the highway at 14 courtesy of my ol man. I'm 35 now. Can drive manual. Experience with oversize on a flat bed. I work hard, probably throw myself into work more than I should lol. I'm willing to try anything EXCEPT doubles. Had my experience and don't like it. I'm not lazy, if I need to do some manual labor it's okay. Will probably kick my butt at first as it's been a while but it doesn't scare me. I've done multi stop stores before. Again, willing to start ASAP. I don't care what I drive just make sure it has AC, heat, and dot legal. I'm more of an old school driver and I'm not one to disappoint. I have a TWIC card somewhere around here. Pretty sure it's still good but I'd have to find it to know for sure. Getting my hazmat shouldn't be a problem either.

I'm a 31 year old father of two seeking new work. I'm looking for more of a work life balance. I'm currently needing to be off at least by 2:30pm Monday through Friday. I have to get my son daily from daycare. Daycare already cost an arm and leg. I can't pay late fees or risk losing a sitter. I also have a daughter from a past relationship. So I 100% spend every weekend with her. I'm having a hard time find a employer that understands I can not lose these things. Im making ends meet fine. It's getting stressful to almost not be able to make it on time for my children. I just want to be upfront about my needs. I know that someone has work that can benefit my schedule. I'm currently making $21 per hour working Monday through Friday. I can not take less than this. I am open to 36/40 hours a week. Also I'm a early bird so early shifts are welcomed. I am open to working 10s as well. Im only looking for work within South Seattle, as I live in White center. I have a vast amount of different work history. I'm currently a delivery driver for a Machine shop. I have experience with working as a sales associate for Nordstrom. I've been in industrial painting. Also have done a ton of shipping and receiving, im an amazing forklift operator over 5 years experience. I can go on. But if you are interested I will send over a current resume."

Successful sales professional seeks evening appointments,https://seattle.craigslist.org/est/res/d/successful-sales-professional-seeks/7405492645.html,"Very successful construction sales professional and former general contractor seeks role to engage and close evening appointments for construction, remodeling, or related B2C in-home sales. Evenings are when clients are typically most available—and when they buy.
I have a significant sales background in B2C construction and related services, with additional, major success in B2B sales. I have a broad knowledge of residential construction, finish work, plumbing, electrical, concrete, etc. More importantly, I understand people—and why they buy.
My closure rate is exceptionally strong in a crowded, competitive field; I sell on value, not price.
Me: Polished professional with 15+ years of successful sales experience. Nice vehicle, high credit score, squeaky-clean background. Four-year degree and MBA program. I understand and practice deal architecture; I am not an order taker. I practice a consultative sales approach that effectively qualifies clients both into and out of the sales pipeline. I make an excellent first impression both by phone and in person.
I currently work full-time in sales during the day for an excellent employer and am not interested in quitting my very nice 9-5 day job. If you’re looking for someone to punch your 40-hour clock to attend “sales training” and lugubrious sales meetings, I’m not your guy. I only want to close profitable deals for you, after-hours via in-home sales. I fully know, and understand my value in this process. Collaboration is great, but I will not need you, or anyone else to close my deals.
I’m experienced with a variety of CRM solutions, including Salesforce. Significant knowledge of digital marketing tools and platforms, MS Office, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, and G-Suite, Google Docs, Google Sheets. Although I prefer a Windows machine, I’m equally competent with a Mac and will adjust. I have fully functional home and mobile offices. I’m a fast learner of new technology and CRM apps.
Ideally, I'm looking for a commission-based structure that will pay very well on an average of one appointment per evening set during the week.
I’m a fast learner, I don’t require sales training and function with minimal sales management bandwidth. I will probably be able to understand and sell what you have to offer in very short order.
Just so we’re on the same page, please check my math on this potential sales and commission structure:
1 appointment per weekday evening
2 appointments on Saturday
7 appointments per week total
35% closure rate
$10,000 average sale
$24,500 weekly gross sales
10% commission rate
$2,450 weekly commission
Annual sales $1,274,000
Annual commission $127,400
Same as above, at a 30% closure rate yields:
$21,000 weekly gross sales
$2,100 weekly commission
Annual sales $1,092,000
Annual commission $109,200
Same as above, at a 25% closure rate yields:
$17,500 weekly gross sales
$1,750 weekly commission
Annual sales $910,000
Annual commission $91,000
I’m looking for a situation that aligns with the above calculations. Of course, if your average sale is $20k, the numbers will be 2X the numbers shown above.
Interested? Let’s schedule a 20-minute phone conversation to see if we have common ground and then meet if we’re aligned"

I am currently searching to help someone with their app/app prototype. I can see the whole project through from start to finish. I will undercut most other firms and you will be working directly with me.
I am currently out of work due to COVID-19 related issues, I've been on a computer since I was 9 and code in a ton of different languages. So figuring out new technologies is no big deal to me if I do not understand something, I pick up on it pretty fast. But, I can code in html/css/javascript/react/react native/dart/flutter/php/wordpress/python/ruby/ruby on rails/BASIC/pascal etc etc.
I also know some devops stuff. I would be willing to work for a firm provided it was at least 35 an hour. Or if you just want an app put on the app store/play store or both, then we can do that as well.
My work experience with coding has been contract work for individuals, bands, companies, web magazines, and my own startup which I am still adjusting to get a good mvp.
It would mean a lot to me because I gotta pay rent and other bills, and I would give you a great deal of value in return. win/win."

I'm looking for a job that allows me to make real, personal connections with people, feel like I'm really taking a weight off their shoulders, and making their lives easier. Every job I've had revolves around my ability to communicate well and clearly with others. In my pervious career I also had to manage my time, the flow of work, customers needs and expectations, while providing solutions and maintaining attention to detail. I worked using multiple computer software programs, so learning how to use more than one tool with its own rules is nothing new. I believe those skills are transferable to any type of customer service. It's a job that takes wearing multiple hats and accomplishing tasks on top of making sure customers are helped. I would love to set up an interview at the earliest opportunity.
Thank you for your consideration,

"Need someone to set up, clean up, or train your staff in QuickBooks?",https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/res/d/need-someone-to-set-up-clean-up-or/7402757666.html,"Has your company grown to the point where it would be nice to have someone come in on a regular basis to train, tutor, support, and help instruct you & your staff in QuickBooks (not Quick Books, BTW) or Quicken & let you make more money?
I am an Advanced Certified Advanced QuickBooks ProAdvisor (the only one in this section the last time I checked) certified in QuickBooks desktop and online (PC and Mac) for 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007 with additional certification in current versions of Intuit's Point of Sale and Enterprise Solutions software, additional training in QuickBooks for the Mac, Intuit Payroll, and a member of Intuit's Accountant, Small Business, and Turbo Tax Inner Circle programs which advise the company on these accounting, bookkeeping, tax preparation, and financial management software.
From 2014 to 2020, I was named a Top 100 (QuickBooks) ProAdvisor by Insightful Accountant (formerly Intuitive Accountant) in the world out of 100,000 eligible nominees. I have 57 reviews on the Intuit Find a ProAdvisor website where I am usually ranked first for Seattle (or $eattle if you are trying to buy a residence, smile), 26 on Yelp (rhymes with whelp of which 14 are displayed), 14 on LinkedIn, five on Angie's List, the Better Business Bureau, and Facebook, and three on Thumbtack, Google, and Nextdoor.
I also use Quicken for Home and Business 2021 in case you need help with that personal financial management software or use it for your business instead. I am comfortable with either the PC or the Mac (my family and I have both).
For two and a half years, I worked as the operations and office manager equivalent to a chief operations officer or COO and a change agent for a 15-22 employee professional services company in the architectural/construction industry that did around $2 million in revenue and had a 22-30% profit margin. During that time period, I was asked to speak about my experience using QuickBooks accounting, bookkeeping, and financial management software at a national conference for the managers of these types of firms.
What I can accomplish for you is the following:
* Help you decide what version you should use and install your QuickBooks software including any updates and any additional memory to make it run faster and save employee time after making sure that your computer is capable of running the program and your computer is up to date with the latest Windows or Mac OS and security updates, related program updates such as MS Office, and anti virus and anti spyware protection (if you don't have any, I can tell you either how to get one free depending on your communications or cable TV provider or which stores are offering them free after rebate as part of my customer service). If you are networked, I may examine and recommend changes to your routers, server, computers, and wiring to make sure you can open up and access your company file quickly. This is particularly important if you currently use it and are experiencing performance issues.
* Set up your company file including time saving features like recall last transaction or prefill accounts based on your vendor preferences. I can also show you some tricks for managing your customers.
* Protect your company file by restricting what areas of your company file other users can access and what they can do. Some versions of QuickBooks let you do this by account. Do you want everyone to know your business?
* Create or reorganize a chart of (numbered if you want) accounts tied in with your tax return form. Wouldn't you like to save on accountant's fees and use TurboTax to do it yourself?
* Show you how to create customers correctly so if you charge sales tax you will charge them the correct amount due to the new Destination Sales Tax rules that went into effect on July 1, 2008 and import the latest sales tax as of the beginning of this quarter for QuickBooks Pro, Premier, Mac, or Enterprise or use the new sales tax module in QuickBooks Online. Or synchronize your customers with Outlook depending on which edition you have.
* How to set up your items and products and services you purchase and/or sell such as services, non inventory, inventory parts and assemblies, groups, other charges, subtotals, customer deposits, partial payments, and sales tax items.
* How to memorize reoccurring transactions so you don't have to enter them each month including sales receipts, invoices, bills, and automatic withdrawals.
* Set you up to do direct deposit, online bill pay, or direct pay via credit card to maximize those mileage based cards. It is how I paid for my trip to France to visit my folks in past years.
* Match credit card payments with the net amount after the fees were taken out with your bank statement and why I recommend that you get a processor who takes them out afterwards to save time.
* Show you how to do bank account and credit card downloads and reconciliation and a tip I use to save time. If you are using Bank of America personal cards that can only be downloaded in the Quicken format, I can show you how to import them.
* Set you up in payroll. Show you how to set up additions, deductions (both pre and post tax), the employee and employer portion for the new WA Paid Family Medical Leave Act, garnishments, child support, and Labor and Industries (both employee deductions and company contributions). Arrange to save you time by paying your federal, state, workers compensation, employment security, and city taxes online and through Electronic Funds Transfers (EFT).
* Show you methods of data entry, recording checks, payments, and other transfers to make it easier to understand what they were for when you do your year's end reporting.
* Show you how to create and memorize and organize your financial statements and reports and how to use the export to Excel feature.
* Demonstrate ways to create and customize invoices (including importing logos) in QuickBooks and use it with MS Office (Word, Excel, or send them via Outlook, or web-based services).
* How to determine who gets a 1099 form and what you need to ask to generate one. I can even throw in a letter and a form you can use. And show you a tip on how I include one with every invoice or sales receipt.
* Help you obtain Intuit Enhanced or Assisted Payroll (they pay taxes and file forms) at a discount, QuickBooks Pro, Premier, or Mac for less than Amazon provided you obtain a merchant account or order other Intuit products from me, QuickBooks Online for 50% off Intuit's price for the first year (a better deal than getting one of their 50% off for X months deals and then owing your first born afterwards), Enterprise at up to 20% off Intuit's price for life using my special pricing including renewals for 1-10 users and 12.5% for up to 30. Why pay full price when I will bring value to the table (even if you choose someone else to work with)?
* Refer you for Intuit's no monthly fee or minimum credit card processing currently at 1.5% swiped for QuickBooks Enterprise, 2.2% swiped (better than Square or PayPal and it directly deposits with no deductions from the gross to your bank got desktop or oneline, 2.4% only using Intuit's GoPayment mobile reader, and 2.9% to 3.1% for manually entered (keyed) transactions. If you are willing to go monthly or you process a lot, the rates are much lower. You also get the right to send an invoice to a customer and have them pay through their bank account. The cost to you is one to three dollars, the price of a two stamps and time to be paid faster. For Online, there is a lower fee.
I have worked with QuickBooks Pro, Premier, Enterprise, Online, Simple Start editions (PC or Mac) from 2000 onward and have the current PC versions installed as well as 2006 onward on my computer. I also keep my books in the Online version. By the way, QuickBooks it isn't spelled as Quick Books but I am mentioning this in case you entered those two words as your search terms as I have noticed a few resumes with that misspelling.
Please reply with your name, company name, address, web site, phone, electronic mail address, how long you have been in business, year and version of QuickBooks, number of employees, number of unique users in the program, and a summary of what you need done or want to accomplish. And I can come to you remotely or maybe in a""gas-guzzling"" Prius, smile, in ""always sunny"" Greater Seattle (or $eattle if you are trying to rent or buy a residence).
Isn't it time you started sleeping at night or learning how to fi$h for yourself or make Tofu if you are a vegan?."

I am currently seeking a remote customer service position with standard office hours Monday-Friday. Open to part time or full time at the moment, but would only be open to a part time position if it still qualified for full benefits (medical, dental, etc).
At the moment I am currently enrolled in online evening classes at the UW. These currently are at 5pm, so I would ideally like a position where I could work from perhaps 7am-3pm or 8am-4pm. I can do 9am-5pm, but the understanding would need to be that 5pm is a hard out. A shift ending at 3pm or 4pm would make It much likely that I can stick around an extra 15 or 30 minutes if needed.
I currently have both a top of the line MacBook and a desktop iMac, so unless the position requires Windows programs, I can supply my own computer to work from home with. Otherwise, I do have space for a windows desktop as well should the position require it.
Please feel free to contact me via the Craigslist relay email. I also am only interested in positions that are salary or hourly pay. I am not interested in anything that is an “opportunity”, aka: pyramid scheme, so please do not waste your time or mine. EMPLOYMENT HISTORY

Dear Sir/Madam:
As you may know, most employment agencies place their ""available"" applicants to earn its business.
I am a competent assistant with over 15 years of litigation experience with AV-rated law firms in the country. I have assisted managing partners, associates and paralegals in Business, Entertainment, Labor & Employment, and Real Estate. For the past few years, I have been servicing as a freelance legal assistant. I have interacted with all types of personalities. I feel confident to solicit my services directly with a law firm instead of an employment agency.
Freelancing has acquired me to have excellent organizational and multi-tasking skills to successfully manage multiple assignments and meet deadlines. I constantly have an ear to attorneys and paralegals needs, excelling my experience and knowledge for all practices, especially litigation. My focus and excellent time management skills enable me to work independently without distraction.
I am available for short or long term assignment. Whether your temporary needs from a massive litigation case, fluctuating workloads (resulting from holiday coverage, maternity, family, disability leave or vacation/sick time), or simply when you need a legal assistant with skills in a particular practice area. I am available 7 days a week to fill emergency staffing needs.
I would like to have an opportunity with your firm to verify my claims and my abilities to contribute to your firm. You could also take the opportunity to examine the person behind the resume, and therefore discuss my hourly rate, which is reasonable, and negotiable based on the responsibilities presented.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at the Reply email address.
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future."

Editing and Writing Services,https://raleigh.craigslist.org/res/d/editing-and-writing-services/7403881914.html,"Thank you for stopping to read this. I have been freelance writing since 1998. I have written everything from letters to the military explaining a criminal record, essays for undergraduate, graduate, medical, and law school; including application questions. Dear John letters, short essays, term papers, grant proposals, statements for court, lesson plans, ethics, bioethics, content writing, final projects, theses, speeches, and short stories. You name the topic, I've probably written it at least once. Despite having written on so many subjects over the years,, I do not plagarize; this includes my own previous work.
I went to a local University here on Long Island but did not grow up here. I majored in Sociology (concentrations in poverty and drug abuse) with minors in Psychology and Literature. Because I have been asked previously, my native language is English. I can speak some passable French and very limited Spanish. I can write in read/write in Cyrillic and speak rudimentary Russian. Both of my parents were newspaper editors, so growing up I had to look up a word if I didn't know what it meant.
In order for me to edit a paper, I need what you have written already, a clear copy of what the professor has assigned/the parameters of the project, and links to all sources cited (or to be cited).
If you need me to write something for you, I need the assignment as stated by the professor, sources to be cited(of there are any required). It is also a good idea for me to see a sample of something you have written previously so I can mimic your writing style. If this is not possible, that is fine.
Please note that what I am doing is completely legal. I am creating a work with words. Just as when I have sold some of my artwork. If someone chooses to purchase my work and pass it off as their own, that is not my business. As for editing, if there are any question as to the legality of that, I don't even know where to begin.
One last note, I am a human, not a machine. Please do not message me and ask me to come up with a 5 page essay in less than 24 hours when it is already two days overdue.
Lack of planning on your part in no way constitutes an emergency on my part. Also, if I am not provided with the assignment (as defined by the professor), then I can not write the paper.
Rates vary upon what is needed and how in-depth the subject content needs to be. I usually charge $15 per page for editing and $20 per page for writing. Also, if you do not provide source matetial, I charge $8 for every source that I need to find.
Additionally, all papers are billed in double space format. If the professor states that the assignment should be done in single spacing then what is written will fit the specifications, but will be billed as written in double space format.
I also charge $10 per hour for any reading I need to do to adequately write your paper. That being said I have been a poor (economically) college student spent the bulk of my career working for nonprofits. I'm no mercenary and will work with someone on price should the situation necessitate it.
Conversely, if a project necessitates a lot more of my time of time, I may have to charge more than the prices quoted above. Fees really are dependent on the assignment and what it entails.
I do give ample time for the client to read over everything, and payment is not made until the client is happy with the finished product. Once the paper is paid for the paper is unlocked and no longer my property. What individuals choose to do with anything I have written is solely up to them.
I am well versed in the social sciences, literature, English, Reading Comprehension, art, and conceptual (ie. Biology, Environmental Science, Bioethics etc.) sciences. I am abhorrent when it comes to math, physics, chemistry and anything involving numerical calculations.
So, if you have too much work and not enough time, or you're just not sure how exactly to word something, send me an email and we'll see what I can do to help. In all the years I have done this I only had one complaint, and I honestly do not think that the client even reviewed what I wrote, or anything in the class for that matter.
Thanks for reading this and good luck with your studies."

DIY/Repair/Construction Experience Sought,https://raleigh.craigslist.org/res/d/diy-repair-construction-experience/7400272906.html,"Overview: I am seeking short projects (example, up to 2 months) to gain experience in construction / DIY home repair around the Garner (within 30 minute drive). I think Id be suitable for anyone with a small job or DIY project who knows what they're doing, but wants an extra pair of hands to get the project done easier. My reason for posting is I have a fantasy of building my own off-grid home in the next few years so am looking for chances to learn concrete, carpentry, framing, plumbing, welding, solar, water filtration, roofing, etc - anything related that you can imagine. If we agree to have me along for a job, you should expect to do some supervision and training at least in the beginning, but you shouldn't need to hold my hand too long.
Need to know: My current skill level is entry-level. I've done small home repairs and DIY projects from being a homeowner (example: painting, fixing cracks in walls and concrete, fixing cabinets, leaky pipes, etc). I got the basics, but nothing as substantial as framing a house or building a deck by myself. I do understand the basics more advanced projects from watching hundreds of hours of people building homes, and if brought on for a job, I would study what I can before showing up to work. Mainly, I want the experience of actually doing it rather than studying videos.
Some things about me: I am 6' tall, can lift over 50lbs easily, and Im 38. I am legal to work in the US and only speak English. I have no health issues and dont use drugs or alcohol. I have graduate degrees in education and accounting and worked as a college professor and CPA most of my professional career (not so helpful to building anything really). I'm not afraid to get dirty and make a sincere effort when it comes to work. If we agree that Ill be somewhere at 830am, Im usually there at 820am. I consider my attitude to be pretty positive and am easy to get along with for most people.
Compensation: You should be prepared to provide all tools and materials. Money is not my main motivator, but if I'm doing a great job and you feel I'm adding value, this is an opportunity to just pay whatever you feel I'm worth based on performance - if at the end of the day I've screwed things up or just slowed you down, pay $0. If you finished a job a few days early and quality was good, happy to take a few bucks in appreciation. Simple as that.
Jobs with high risk (i.e. electrical or roofing) I may have more concerns about how to avoid not dying. I tend to prefer not dying as a way of life. Otherwise, I am gauging projects based on the potential to learn new skills, so please help me by explaining as clearly as possible what I might be doing with you. Thank you for reading."

I have extensive experience with Facebook and Instagram ads as well as connections and information about website design, marketing, etc. I have used sites in order to track my time, and streamline social media postings like Later, Paymo, and online store websites like Shopify & Weebly.
If you are looking for a VA and Social Media Marketer / Manager, look no further! I am for hire, and will exceed your expectations. I have flexible availability and am able to work on an as-needed OR scheduled basis (as little as 1 hour a week or full time!)
Please feel free to reach out to me for more information.
If you have any other work (that can be done 100% remotely), please also feel free to reach out to me! I would love to discuss any and all opportunities. I have a Bachelors degree, and a Culinary Arts and Restaurant Management degree as well. At this time I am not considering any type of MLM ventures, CBD sales, ItWorks or any kind of platform that is similar.
Thanks so much,
-Allison"

He possesses expert-level technical (i.e., information technology) skills sets and can learn most windows-based applications in a day (Linux-based ones a little longer).
Consequently, there would be no steep learning curb. Applicant can hit the ground running in whatever role he is assigned irrespective of complexity with little or no direct oversight. He possesses Bachelor's and Master of Science degrees respectively in social and behavioral science (designated by his degrees) from the State University of New York. The applicant is ABD in clinical psychology and, consequently, has both a conceptual and theoretical understanding of psychosocial behavioral determinants; diagnoses (DSM-V); and implementing treatment and behavioral plans.
The applicant also has formal legal training, (but he has not taken the bar or, by extension, requested to waive into either the federal or state bars). Nevertheless, this training has served him well in his previous work experiences. Applicant prefers a set schedule (evenings or overnights only). Any 2 “on-call” and/or shift flexibility requirements must be negotiated and agreed to prior to an offer of employment; and, appropriately remunerated for the shift(s) applicant is required to be 2 “on call.” Applicant prefers electronic mail or text notifications as opposed to impromptu telephone calls.

are doing their mobile app launch first and website later. Whatever is your mobile app requirement,

PHOTO IDENTITY AT YOUR DISPOSAL FOR SERIOUS INQUIRERS. I'm 29, born in '92 if that's relevant.
Greetings Caring Comrades:
I am seeking an administrative career position (5 years experience) with a passion for creative writing (songs and poems mostly) and a heavy interest in the non-profit sector and children's care services due to my own adversities. In fact, I hope to one day open a children's center situated around the arts (song writing, singing, playing, dance etc.) to be called Chasesop's Center for Song where we spread art through the lessons in music, where you unfablely belong.
I surely bring the required qualifications to the table as I have most recently held a position as a Front Desk Clerk (Temp) at a housing non-profit and currently in student housing, as well as previous posts as a Pet Care Manager/ Receptionist, Salon Coordinator, Bed & Breakfast Front Desk Receptionist, and Volunteer Salon Front Desk Receptionist throughout my later teens. I, also, have endured many physically and mentally demanding obstacles in my previous factory setting. I hope to grow in this field to gain the knowledge to pursue my passion. I'd, also, potentially be interested in a volunteer opportunity. All of which brings me to the conclusion that I am the missing puzzle piece in your dream team.
I hope to gain access to a job in which I am able to express my literary talents and pursue further care experience while aiding the wave of our future voices, authors, poets, lyricists etc. advance beyond their wildest expectations. I am more than certain that I am capable of performing the essential duties of the position. Therefore, I would welcome an opportunity to prove my capabilities and strive to achieve every expectation and beyond.
Applicable Skills:
-Multitasking and the ability to operate technology efficiently and effectively in a timely manner.
-Keeping records and maintaining equipment functions.
-Communication, relationship building, client growth, and the ability to access needs and provide the desired information.
-Disciplined responsibility of cleanliness and time management.
-Scheduling, advertising, billing, budgeting, filing, proofreading, editing, ordering supplies, creativity, and organization
Throughout my experiences much has been expected of me, and I have always risen to the challenge. My performance stands out from among my peers, and I will continue my efforts to be the best at everything I pursue. Thank you for your time and the opportunity to present myself as a worthy candidate for employment.
Best,
Chase Bond"

Rookie Film Producer Looking for a Project,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/res/d/rookie-film-producer-looking-for-project/7410175947.html,"Hello!! Well, the title says it all.
I've always been interested in movies and TV shows, and been fascinated about how they have been made. I was an actor a long time ago and I've helped out people make films but it's been quite a while. I am a writer and have written a self-published novel. I've written screenplays as well.
I am currently an Interactive Product Manager, making enhancements to a couple very large online retail brands, so I already work in production, just not in film production.
I've been looking for a career change, I'm 45, and the idea of making a movie/show has always been exciting to me.
So, I'm throwing it out there that I'm looking for a project. Would probably be a good idea to start with something small. But I would like to work with a writer/director and get this thing produced and put out there whether it be on YouTube or a website, or whatever.
Please note I am not offering to pay for your project if you need funding. If I believe in it I have no problem trying to raise money if needed. I am also not looking to get paid for this. I simply want to try it out and see if I love it.
Anyway, if you're interested, please feel free to reach out to me via email. You can send me your script or short story and if I'm into it, I'll respond.

Dear Human Resources
Because my experience in solving problems, streamlining processes to make them run smoother, creating cost effective measures, and positive communication skills (both verbal and written) will be of great benefit to your organization.
Nalco Chemical Company experience of progressive responsibility with one major chemical Manufacturing processing company which is not a drawback. I began at the bottom doing laboring type tasks and by hard work and determination and constant on-the-job learning, I progressed through several departments and several different positions (listed below) into an inventory position with even greater responsibilities and better pay. By knowing the product and functions of the company inside and out at all levels I was able to more effectively manage the areas under my control in my last position. I have a ""can-do"" attitude and thrive on improving conditions and procedures to eliminate waste, generate more profit, and maintain a safe work environment.
Nalco Chemical demonstrated skills in procurements and control in multi million dollars of inventory, customer service, training, shipping and receiving. Strong organizational skills and ability to multi-task and perform projects efficiently. Self-starter who communicates well with management, staff, suppliers and vendors.
Basic computer skills AS 400, SAP. MS Office: Word, Outlook, Excel, Internet, e-mail. Windows 10
Please contact me to set an interview time in order for us to discuss in greater depth how we can be of mutual benefit to each other. I am looking forward to talking with you.
Sincerely,
Tom Hynes

Artist Looking for Side Gig/s,https://chicago.craigslist.org/chc/res/d/artist-looking-for-side-gig/7415064956.html,"I am looking for part-time work ONLY. Email only, if you'd like a phone call please provide your number in your reply.
Hello!
If you'd like to see my full resume, please respond to this ad. I'm looking for anything a little different, especially if it'll teach me new skills, so I figured the best way to avoid run-of-the-mill stuff would be to have a sort of informal ad. Thanks!
I'm currently a full time artist, doing strange and silly illustrations and selling strange and silly clothes, but honestly I'm getting a little bored/lonely! I work from home, although I would even if there wasn't a pandemic, and I have zero coworkers. I've been doing this kind of work for about a decade, but only for a little over a year have I been doing it as my sole income after leaving a job because of a poorly managed covid outbreak. I love my art job dearly and all of the people I do work for, it will always come first before any other gig I may take, but frankly I'd like some variety.
I have hefty experience with self managing, direct client communication, social media (I currently have 10.6k Twitter followers) and illustration. I do not do graphic design, and only know a little about it, but would love to learn. From my past jobs I also have a lot of experience with phone calls, scheduling appointments, problem solving, being general support for other staff, errand running, food prep, nannying (kids age 5-10), and a little bit of retail. I also have dabbled in several other artforms, including ceramics and sculpture.
I'm looking for something interesting, engaging, and involved. I'd love to get to know whoever I'm working for and my coworkers! I miss working directly with other people to get jobs done and am still very close with several people I've worked with at my previous job. Basically, I want to feel involved in at least some sort of in-person community again. I'd be volunteering at the Field Museum, but they aren't taking volunteers again yet because of covid.
A little bit about myself, I'm very interested in art and illustration (of course), but my other main passions include being outdoors, animals/zoology, and writing. I also skateboard a little and love biking! Anything that gets me out and around and learning is exciting for me, and I love picking up new skills and knowledge.
If you'd like to see my resume and references, please let me know, I'm happy to send them. I'd also be happy to show you my Instagram if you'd like to see my work!
At the moment most of my projects are small, but in the near future I plan on illustrating a short comic that may take up a lot of my time. If you are able to give me flexible hours that would be amazing!
Thanks for you time, please don't hesitate to ask any questions."

I graduated with a business degree which really jump-started my drive. However, my childhood dream was always to own multiple businesses so I guess I should credit that. I absolutely love working with other entrepreneurs. I figured since I was able to build my dream I should help others build theirs. I devise a strategy through intense research for each and every business I work with. There is not a one size fits all social media strategy and understanding that is key, but I can help you find the one that works for your business.
Creating content and captions is a main part of what I do but engagement is by far the most important part of how I help clients. Engagement helps your followers get a more personal view of you and helps them feel connected, thus bringing back more business regardless of if you are a service provider or sell products. Engagement is also one of the hardest things for business owners to do since it can take up so much time. That is why I am here to help!
If you are struggling with social media for your business, or even if you aren't and you just want to outsource it then visit my website and schedule a consultation! During that consult we will go over your difficulties and your goals so that I can craft a strategy unique to you!

Because my experience in solving problems, streamlining processes to make them run smoother, creating cost effective measures, and positive communication skills (both verbal and written) will be of great benefit to your organization.
Nalco Chemical Company experience of progressive responsibility with one major chemical Manufacturing processing company which is not a drawback. I began at the bottom doing laboring type tasks and by hard work and determination and constant on-the-job learning, I progressed through several departments and several different positions (listed below) into an inventory position with even greater responsibilities and better pay. By knowing the product and functions of the company inside and out at all levels I was able to more effectively manage the areas under my control in my last position. I have a ""can-do"" attitude and thrive on improving conditions and procedures to eliminate waste, generate more profit, and maintain a safe work environment.
Nalco Chemical demonstrated skills in procurements and control in multi million dollars of inventory, customer service, training, shipping and receiving. Strong organizational skills and ability to multi-task and perform projects efficiently. Self-starter who communicates well with management, staff, suppliers and vendors.

Editing and Writing Services,https://boston.craigslist.org/gbs/res/d/editing-and-writing-services/7408733168.html,"Thank you for stopping to read this. I have been freelance writing since 1998. I have written everything from letters to the military explaining a criminal record, essays for undergraduate, graduate, medical, and law school; including application questions.
Dear John letters, short essays, term papers, grant proposals, statements for court, lesson plans, ethics, bioethics, content writing, final projects, theses, speeches, and short stories. You name the topic, I've probably written it at least once. Despite having written on so many subjects over the years,, I do not plagarize; this includes my own previous work.
I went to a local University here on Long Island but did not grow up here. I majored in Sociology (concentrations in poverty and drug abuse) with minors in Psychology and Literature. Because I have been asked previously, my native language is English. I can speak some passable French and very limited Spanish. I can write in read/write in Cyrillic and speak rudimentary Russian. Both of my parents were newspaper editors, so growing up I had to look up a word if I didn't know what it meant.
In order for me to edit a paper, I need what you have written already, a clear copy of what the professor has assigned/the parameters of the project, and links to all sources cited (or to be cited).
If you need me to write something for you, I need the assignment as stated by the professor, sources to be cited(of there are any required). It is also a good idea for me to see a sample of something you have written previously so I can mimic your writing style. If this is not possible, that is fine.
Please note that what I am doing is completely legal. I am creating a work with words. Just as when I have sold some of my artwork. If someone chooses to purchase my work and pass it off as their own, that is not my business. As for editing, if there are any question as to the legality of that, I don't even know where to begin.
One last note, I am a human, not a machine. Please do not message me and ask me to come up with a 5 page essay in less than 24 hours when it is already two days overdue.
Lack of planning on your part in no way constitutes an emergency on my part. Also, if I am not provided with the assignment (as defined by the professor), then I can not write the paper.
Rates vary upon what is needed and how in-depth the subject content needs to be. I usually charge $15 per page for editing and $20 per page for writing. Also, if you do not provide source matetial, I charge $8 for every source that I need to find.
Additionally, all papers are billed in double space format. If the professor states that the assignment should be done in single spacing then what is written will fit the specifications, but will be billed as written in double space format.
I also charge $10 per hour for any reading I need to do to adequately write your paper. That being said I have been a poor (economically) college student spent the bulk of my career working for nonprofits. I'm no mercenary and will work with someone on price should the situation necessitate it.
Conversely, if a project necessitates a lot more of my time of time, I may have to charge more than the prices quoted above. Fees really are dependent on the assignment and what it entails.
I do give ample time for the client to read over everything, and payment is not made until the client is happy with the finished product. Once the paper is paid for the paper is unlocked and no longer my property. What individuals choose to do with anything I have written is solely up to them.
I am well versed in the social sciences, literature, English, Reading Comprehension, art, and conceptual (ie. Biology, Environmental Science, Bioethics etc.) sciences. I am abhorrent when it comes to math, physics, chemistry and anything involving numerical calculations.
So, if you have too much work and not enough time, or you're just not sure how exactly to word something, send me an email and we'll see what I can do to help. In all the years I have done this I only had one complaint, and I honestly do not think that the client even reviewed what I wrote, or anything in the class for that matter.
Thanks for reading this and good luck with your studies."

Elderly Care,https://boston.craigslist.org/gbs/res/d/elderly-care/7408260700.html,"Hello! I am a fully vaccinated (plus flu shot), 37 year old female seeking hours as a care provider for the elderly. I have over 14 years of care experience with the elderly. I also work in hospice and bereavement assessment as a volunteer at BILH in training for an End of Life Doula certification through an organization called INELDA. Caring for people is something that gives me purpose, I genuinely enjoy spending time in their homes with them- no matter what stage of life they are in. I can cook, grocery shopping, do light cleaning, go for walks, help create and work on projects, read to your loved one or just sit quietly and enjoy the day together. My only restriction is that I cannot do heavy lifting, so if your loved one needs to be picked up, I cannot do that. I can assist, assuming the person is steady on their feet and capable of baring weight and in the event of an emergency I could lift someone, but not otherwise, unfortunately. I have been certified in CPR training many times and have many wonderful references, both personal and work related. I do drive and have an excellent record (I drove people's children around for many years), but I do not own a car.
Please contact me with any questions and hopefully we can meet up soon!"

Remote Medical Billing & Coding,https://austin.craigslist.org/res/d/remote-medical-billing-coding/7408100874.html,"Hi,
My name is Devin Prochazka. I am actively seeking employment as a medical biller/coder in an entry-level position and preferably in a remote work setting. Here is a little information about myself if you are interested. Thank you for your time!
With a formal background specializing in documentation, data entry and administration management, I am really enthusiastic about my new career move to Medical Billing and Coding. I am seeking a remote Medical Billing and Coding position in which I can utilize my excellent attention-to-detail, organization, time management, and analytical skills to do the job right and also efficiently.
As of October 2021, I received a Medical Billing and Coding Career Diploma with Honors from Ashworth College and I have taken the exam with the NHA (National Healthcareer Association) to become CBCS certified (Certified Billing and Coding Specialist) and I am awaiting results from that test. I also plan to become CPC (Certified Professional Coder) certified with AAPC (American Academy of Professional Coders) because I am currently an AAPC member, and also I've noticed that many employers are seeking certification with them. Lastly, I am currently attending school at Texas A&M Corpus Christi, enrolled in their Certified Risk Adjustment course to be able to gain the CRC (Certified Risk Adjustment Coder) credential as well.
Here are just a few reasons that I believe your company would benefit by having me as an employee:
* I am a very positive, team-oriented, helpful and enthusiastic person and get the largest of jobs done even under pressure.
* I have excellent attention-to-detail, organization, and data entry skills.
* I have a strong work ethic. I am self-driven, self-motivated, and a natural leader.
* I am respectful and courteous to others and have always gained respect by how I treat others and my dedication to my team and my work.
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
Regards,

"Tutor, Teacher, Writer, Reviser, Consultant, and Technician Available",https://austin.craigslist.org/res/d/tutor-teacher-writer-reviser-consultant/7394687307.html,"Hello,
My name is Patrick. I recently moved to Cedar Park, TX from New York City, NY, where I was born and raised. I graduated from, and earned magna cum laude grades at, the prestigious Bronx High School of Science in the Bronx, NY 10468 where I aced extremely challenging courses, such as AP Calculus BC, AP Physics C, AP Latin, and AP Statistics. Afterwards, I graduated from Polytechnic University in downtown Brooklyn, NY 11201 with a Bachelor of Science degree in technical and professional communication. I also took many mechanical engineering courses, such as Solid Edge and Mechanics of Materials, which covered fascinating engineering topics, such as modulus of elasticity and stress/strain relationships. After graduating from Polytechnic University, I worked for Best Buy et alia. More recently, I've been tutoring in various subjects, writing and revising documents, and offering electronics consultations and technology services, such as upgrades, repairs, and optimizations. Below is a list of all the services I offer.
1) I can tutor and teach ESL/English, Spanish, Mandarin/Cantonese/Shanghainese Chinese, Italian, Latin, German, math, physics, computer technology concepts, penmanship, and TOEFL/IELTS/SAT/SHSAT test preparation. I have many students in these subjects.
2) I am adept at writing and revising impeccable documents, such as resumes, cover letters, personal statements, research papers, blogs, and user manuals. In fact, I've been writing and revising documents for several years.
3) I am adroit at repairing, upgrading, installing and removing software, optimizing computer performance, and offering advice/consultations on electronics, having worked at many electronics and office supply stores, such as Best Buy, Fry's, MarketSource at Target, and Staples.
4) I can serve as a personal assistant at an office or at a public place, such as La Madeleine or Starbucks. I have lots of relevant experience, having worked as a clerical worker/office assistant at the Youth in Engineering and Science (YES) Department at Polytechnic University during my undergraduate years. Also, I worked for many years at the office of Himax Dream Eyewear, an eyeglass frames wholesaler based in downtown Flushing, NY 11355.
Unfortunately, since I don't know how to drive, I would have to meet you at or near the La Madeleine at 14028 N, US-183 Suite 230 E, Austin, TX 78717 to perform the work that you have for me. Also, please understand that I am a huge germophobe. My condition was exacerbated by this coronavirus pandemic. So, I politely ask that you do not touch me or my clothes. I promise you I won't touch you, either.
Feel free to suggest prices, since I have no set prices in mind. I accept cash, Amazon egift cards, and PayPal funds at the end of each session. If you are interested in any of the above services I offer, please call or text me at show contact info . Should you want to examine my resume, I would be more than happy to email it to you.
Thank you!"

Business Development Pro / Lead Qualification / Confirmation,https://atlanta.craigslist.org/nat/res/d/business-development-pro-lead/7412162116.html,"Successful business owner looking for remote work from my well appointed home office with a Direct Sales Company that provides Pre Set Appointments for their Inside and or Outside Sales teams.
I owned an Atlanta based Security System Company that grew to 6 S.E. locations and was written up in several National Industry and Business Publications because of our rapid growth and excellent reputation for quality and service. We had a great ten year run and were fortunate to do quite well when we sold our company to a large Florida Corp. Since then for many years I've been helping other entrepreneurs start and build direct Sales Companies. In varied industries. And every one has been a great success. One of the biggest reasons why is that the Marketing Model was built with solid accurate lead lists...Appointment Setters who knew how to connect with prospects...and selling interest in taking a look at our company products and services. Then confirmation pros called them back made sure the lead qualified connected again then put it on the schedule. Our demo and conversion rates were all way above industry average and my businesses realized profits in 30-45 days. I hired and trained everyone. My Sales Teams too. And though my work weeks were 75+ hrs ( Our last Appt for in home sales was 8pm and I do the TO's ) I loved every minute. Now I'm looking to make the lead qualification and confirmation calls from my home office and work a 40 hr week so I can enjoy my personal life that I sacrificed for years.
I will ""Tee Up"" the best leads you could ever want and with a team of great closers your increase in Sales Volume will be immediate. And if you need help in setting up your Marketing Campaigns and/or building your Sales and Appointment Setting teams I can help you there as well.
I'm looking to team up with a solid well respected company that has a positive upbeat productive culture
and is going places. And an appreciation for people that work hard to help you get there.
I've been fortunate in my career to do very well financially so my compensation requirements have changed. Plus working at home and not being on the road for extended periods of time has great value to me. I'm looking for a respectable Salary plus Commission plan that will allow me to share in the Company success. And just as important to me is working with a terrific team of winners.
If you are interested in speaking with me please contact me back with your name title and some company info. And of course a brief job description. If I think we might be a fit I will reply promptly and set up a call.
I look forward to speaking with you."
